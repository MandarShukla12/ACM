ML notebooks contains all the jupyter notebooks in the Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera.

The rest of the files are for a Project, which uses computer vision to check if a patient has covid-19 or not.

EDIT: Have gone through some of the tutorials on huggingface.co for NLP. Also have started going through Jason Brownlees book on NLP.
